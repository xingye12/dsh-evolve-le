# Documentation

This index separates normative specifications, operator guidance, evidence, and historical records. Start with the
short path that matches your task.

> 重新实现基线。`docs/audits/`、`CHANGELOG.md` 与各 release/migration 文档记录的是**前代项目**的
> 状态，不构成本仓库证据；当前可声称的状态一律以 [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](../PROJECT_STATUS.md) 为准。

## Document authority

When records conflict, use this precedence:

1. frozen run manifest and content-addressed receipts;
2. normative files in `specs/`;
3. operational documents in `docs/`;
4. README and historical discussion.

Historical audits intentionally retain predecessor names, paths, failures, and claim wording. Do not modernize them
in place; add a successor record.
