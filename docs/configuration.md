# Configuration

`dsh-evolve-le init` writes a private, no-replace `config.json`. `stable-demo` uses schema 12; the multi-file
`v011-stable-demo` profile uses schema 13 and protocol `dsh-evolve-le-candidate-tree-v2`. The file contains no credential.
Changing an identity, profile or limit requires a new state directory and run ID.

`v011-stable-demo` keeps the same K=3/task/budget/model ceilings while replacing the single-file patch proposal with
the bounded multi-file candidate-tree protocol, exact-parent Loader proposal mode, raw evidence citations,
candidate-owned tests, admission receipts and mechanism-outcome feedback. Its failure-discovery order is frozen
outcome-blind from published inventory metadata: `hard` before `medium` before `easy`, then shortest timeout and task
ID. This increases the chance of finding a real failed task without reading candidate rewards or sealed data.
The pool accepts `fail/0` and attributable `invalid/0` non-passes; `invalid/null` and any unknown reward remain
excluded. The evaluator's retry/reconciliation layer settles retryable infrastructure outcomes before this filter.
Unlike schema 10's six-task batches, schema 11 evaluates the frozen order sequentially and stops baseline discovery
as soon as the first eligible non-pass is committed, with a hard ceiling of 12 baseline trials.

The bearer is read only from `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the trusted host process. Codex `auth.json`, Codex `config.toml`
and CPA are not part of the default route. `doctor` probes the official `/models` endpoint and fails before a paid
request if the credential, exact route, model, Docker, Harbor, task material, state permissions or budget is unavailable.

For the low-consumption effectiveness gate, set a fresh run ID and no-replace receipt path, then run:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='...'
export DSH_EVOLVE_LE_EFFECT_RUN_ID='effect-local-1'
export DSH_EVOLVE_LE_EFFECT_RECEIPT_PATH="$PWD/evidence/effectiveness/effect-local-1.json"
pnpm effectiveness:official
```

The gate preregisters target and preserved modes, admits both baseline and child, then compares fixed Loader replay
digests. It proves a measurable runtime behavior delta only; it does not prove a Terminal-Bench score improvement.

## Profile bundle runtime variables

When the controller is installed as a profile bundle (`@dsh-evolve-le/core` via `dsh plugin add`), the bundle
requires these environment variables before the profile starts; omission fails Config validation by design:

| Variable                      | Purpose                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `DSH_EVOLVE_LE_STATE_DIR` | Private, no-replace state root |
| `DSH_EVOLVE_LE_RUN_ID`    | Unique identity of the run     |

State directories are private evidence and must not be committed.
